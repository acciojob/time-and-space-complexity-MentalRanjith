	<h1> Time and  Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way of representing how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the size of the input grows. Most efficient time complexity because input size does not affect the algorithm's performance.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> deals with the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. When we say an algorithm has O(n) space complexity, it means that the amount of extra memory required grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
